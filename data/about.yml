  I like fractal patterns, hacks, technological innovation and cognitive systems. In my case that relates to branding, innovation and intelligence. I'm more a big picture guy than a bean counter, which is a bit odd in the data science realm. Unsurprisingly, I'm more fascinated by decision science than kubernetes clusters. I'm interested in: narrative warfare & memetic engineering, SEO, natural language processing, social media mining, machine learning and social science. No, I'm not your industry 4.0 engineer.
