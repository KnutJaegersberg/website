  I score relatively extreme on INTP correlating big 5 dimensions and see in that case communicative value in the caricature of those infamous 16 personality types. I can safely conclude to differ in ways that allow me to unsee more. My character is not over-adjusted, a misfit in some contexts, yet those contexts are less fit than me.

  I like patterns, perspectives, technology and systems. In my case that relates to branding, innovation and intelligence. I'm more a big picture guy than a bean counter, which is a bit odd in the data science realm. Unsurprisingly, I'm more fascinated by decision science than kubernetes clusters. I'm interested in: narrative warfare & memetic engineering, SEO, natural language processing, social media mining, machine learning and social network analysis.
